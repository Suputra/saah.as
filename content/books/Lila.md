 Lila appears to be a book about Morality, and how that connects to [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'s theory of quality. 

Phaedrus really seems to hate the Wests adoration of Socrates and the philosophers that came after him. He goes over this above as well as in his previous book. 

He spends some time considering views of the world. In his previous book, he rejects the subject-object view as missing out on a lot of aspects of reality, in favor of a Quality based approach. However, he refuses to define quality, as that would essentially allow him to fall into a trap.

Phaedrus really doesn't like to lose arguments (makes sense, he was a professor of rhetoric)

In this book, he realizes he has to define quality, and introduce another split to replace the subject / object split. He can't sacrifice communication of his message just because he might lose an argument - there's no perfect worldview. He introduces the split of Static and Dynamic Quality - Dynamic Quality being similar the old idea of Quality (precognitive experience and apprehension before it is cut by the analytic knife). Static Quality is the patterns that are fit based on routine (individual and cultural habits).

One thing I really liked here was his comparison of it to how a child sees the world - children have very little habits, they see a lot of Dynamic Quality - everything they experience is for the first time. His relation of this to the subject-object split is the first thing that made quality more natural for me. The first order object that all Children have is experience, only after weeks and months do they start to have some idea of subject and object. This impression sticks with them and has become a somewhat natural foundation for all human cultures. Quality / Experience is still of the first order, objects and the material world come after that - from our perspective at least.
