Permutation City is about consciousness and computation. I like books and media that spend their whole time framing a thought experiment. Permutation City is one of those books.
The experiment in question is essentially one that boils down to substrate independence. No matter what we run on or how we are run, from our perspective we still "experience" things. This sets up the heat death of the universe as the ultimate computer - finding ourselves in the dust is really finding ourselves in the far future, where time has lost all meaning.
