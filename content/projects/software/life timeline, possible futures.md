I want to create a "life timeline" - I was inspired by this image. 
![[life timeline.png]]
This is a project that will be kind of like a mix between a journal, a timeline, and a vision board for the future.
I want to make this as portable as possible, so let's make the storage device human readable text files (markdown, yaml, or even just text). For future visions / memories, we can use the same naming scheme but the text files can be marked with an i to denote that they are not real yet. I'm thinking for timeline management and hierarchy, we can use git itself. Memories and future memories can all be commits marked with a certain time and date which add the files for one memory, and branches can be used to represent different timelines. Future memories can be commits in the future, and the current time, and the current date / time can be kept track of to understand what is in the future and what is in the present.
