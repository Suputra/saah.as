title: Saahas' Thoughts
---
Hi, I'm Saahas, and these are my thoughts - some real and some still just in my head. I'm an Engineer living in SF working at Zoox, where I work on the Ethernet Network and Time Synchronization on the vehicle.
I've been putting some thought into [[the future of robotics]]. The big project that I want to work on over the next year is [[micro von neumann robots (Âµvn)]].
The things on my mind right now are doing some home improvements ([[greenhouse]]) and working on [[mechanical life]]. I also have a [[resume]].
