Common question is why are we in this universe with constants that are fine tuned for life. In the same vein, why was entropy higher before? Also if many worlds is true, as the wave function evolves, why do we experience a particular measurement of it, and how is that one chosen?

Maybe the premise of these questions is wrong.

equivalence principle - I think there are other things that are like gravity on earth and a spaceship accelerating at 1g, where there's no way we can distinguish.
