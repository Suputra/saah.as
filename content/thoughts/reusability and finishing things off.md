I value reusing old parts and try to bring new life to old components. I think this is from a sense of mine that inherently sees the world as ultra resource constrained (even when it isn't necessarily). I want to squeeze every drop of value out of all of my possessions, and I hate wasting things. Conversely, I also dislike getting new things unless I can 

This relates to [[materialism]]
I don't like getting groceries until the fridge is literally empty (there is absolutely nothing I can make).
